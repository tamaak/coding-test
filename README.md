# Code Test

Base repo for setting up to run tests on a machine.  It is meant to be followed up with a push of code to test after the system has been setup.

If you are not using an IDE like IntelliJ that allows you to configure testing with Java, and you have SBT on your system, you can use ``sbt test`` to run tests from the CLI.
